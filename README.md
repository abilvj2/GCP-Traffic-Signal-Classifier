# GCP-Traffic-Signal-Classifier
This repository hosts an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using Keras with TensorFlow backend, designed to classify traffic sign images with high accuracy. Leveraging the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), this project provides a robust solution for real-time traffic sign recognition.
